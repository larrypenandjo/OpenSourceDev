**OpenSourceDev** is a desktop application with purpose of managing small groups of people meeting together. The target groups are associations of foreigners or amateur football clubs.
The application provides means to easily add or register new members or players and also to have an overview of all registered participants of the association. Data (names, address, profession, etcâ€¦) related to each member can be managed paperless within the application. Events planned by the community can also be saved accordingly. The list of all features supported by the application is going to be detailed in the in the following chapters. 
The application is developed in Java/JavaFX. Data are managed by SQL and the GUI is designed using FXML-files that are edited in Scenebuilder. The IDE used for development is NetBeans and versioning is done via public repository in GitHub. The application shall first be available like a desktop application for Windows platforms, the later on for Macintosh. A Linux version is not yet planed.
